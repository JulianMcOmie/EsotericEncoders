This project is based on my need to create fast-working puzzles for friends. I wanted to be able to write a program in say,
Brainfuck or Whitespace, but it takes too long. This solution is made to speed up that process.

Note: In no way are these programs supposed to be efficient or well-written. In fact, I am trying to use the easiest way possible to write each one which, in most cases, proves to be inversely proportional to quality of code.
